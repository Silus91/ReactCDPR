I have created that page for my portfolio. Here is link to web life.
I strongly recomend to visit that page https://cdred-project.web.app/

First of all, I do not own any of these products or images, videos etc. Its CD Projekt RED fan page. I have created that page for my portfolio for my future recruiters in the Web Development industry. Here are a few technologies I have used to create that page. React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Redux, Firebase, MaterializeCSS, Winstonjs, Sentry and other more-less useful technologies and libraries. You can log in thru Facebook, Google or email and I can assure you, all your data is safe, thanks to Firebase service. In case of any errors I will recive email from Sentry about that error. The web uses the main principles of web development. DRY, KISS, SEO, Mobile First, RWD, Grid, third party API. All UX/UI it is my design and my ideas. All this code is free and accessible from my GitHub Account.
