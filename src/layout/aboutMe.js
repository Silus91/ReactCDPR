I am looking to move into a full-time commercial role in the software industry, where I can build on my 2 years experience. So far I have been working with mainly JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, but I also had exposure to React, TS, Firebase, Sass, MySQL, Git. I am comfortable with the command line and Linux operating system. I constantly expand my knowledge, at the moment I am learning PHP and Laravel. I am a keen and quick learner which can be highlighted in my projects.`
