export const creatorInfo = ['Hi everyone.First of all, I do not own any of these products or images, videos etc. Its CD Projekt RED fan page. Created that page for my portfolio for my future recruiters in the Web Development industry. Here are a few technologies I have used to create that page. React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Redux, Firebase, MaterializeCSS, and other more-less useful technologies and libraries. The web uses the main principles of web development. DRY, KISS, SEO, Mobile First, RWD, Grid, third party API. All UX/UI it is my design and my ideas. All this code is free and accessible from my GitHub Account.'];
