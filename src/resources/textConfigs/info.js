  "Hi everyone.First of all, I do not own any of these products or images, videos etc. Its CD Projekt RED fan page. I have created that page for my portfolio for my future recruiters in the Web Development industry. Here are a few technologies I have used to create that page. React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Redux, Firebase, MaterializeCSS, and other more-less useful technologies and libraries. You can log in thru Facebook, Google or email and I can assure you, all your data is safe, thanks to Firebase service. The web uses the main principles of web development. DRY, KISS, SEO, Mobile First, RWD, Grid, third party API. All UX/UI it is my design and my ideas. All this code is free and accessible from my GitHub Account.",

export const aboutMe = [
  "I have spent the past 2 years focusing on front-end development. I am currently developing part-time and you can find examples of my work on my GitHub account. I am looking to move into a full-time commercial role in the software industry, where I can build on my 2 years experience. So far I have been working with mainly JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, but I also had exposure to React, TS, Firebase, Sass, MySQL, Git. I am comfortable with the command line and Linux operating system. I constantly expand my knowledge, at the moment I am learning PHP and Laravel. I am a keen and quick learner which can be highlighted in my projects.",
